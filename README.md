# Python Algorithm Implementation Project

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to implementing various algorithms using Python with the primary goal of learning through hands-on coding. This project focuses on explaining actual code implementations rather than delving into the theoretical details.

## Language
All documentation and code explanations in this project are provided in Japanese.

## Algorithms Covered
The repository includes implementations of the following algorithms, along with detailed code explanations:
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Search algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Algorithm)

## How to Use
Clone the repository and navigate to the directory of the algorithm you are interested in. Each directory contains Python scripts for running the specific algorithm.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://your-github-repository-link
# Navigate to the algorithm directory
cd path/to/algo
# Run the script
python3 app.py
